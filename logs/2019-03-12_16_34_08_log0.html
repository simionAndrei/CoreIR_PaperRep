[2019.03.12-16:34:15] Selected utterance Hi William,  1) The Link Data keeps the chart linked to the original worksheet which means you can edit it PowerPoint inside while using Paste link will regard it as chart object which means you have to edit it in Excel. Besides, the latter will automatically update the data by default.  2) The instruction in your post is applied to PowerPoint 2010 instead of Office 2016, which is the reason why you failed before. Please refer to the instructions in the following article. Link a section of data in Excel to PowerPoint  Regards, WilliamDavid

[2019.03.12-16:34:15] Selected utterance Well, s/he's not completely nuts, Courtneymy, but the 'dot' is below the bottom edge of the list. It can be used to increase the list height to expose more rows if necessary, but its height cannot be decreased to display fewer than 8 rows. The OP's list isn't showing at all... Nor are the controls that should appear above the list, although the dot is there.  The point is that - even if no Animations are applied or selected, the Animation Pane list should default to at least 8 rows tall.

[2019.03.12-16:34:15] Selected utterance Hey there, Preston  Im glad my reply was helpful!   With the ink been a bit sketchy. Doing a nozzle check is the right way to go about things. It may be that they need re aligning or adjusting.   Lets see how that goes. They may need to be re tuned as well. If those fail, check to see how much ink you have left, just to make sure its not running out   Regards,

[2019.03.12-16:34:15] Selected utterance Is there a way to configure Skype for Android sounds and main screen? I would like to replace the truly annoying dialing sound and configure the main screen for proper usability. The dialing sound is obvious, I would like something better (subjectively speaking). But for the Skype main screen, I would like to get rid of the useless "Highlights" and "Capture" screens and replace them with the useful "Contacts" and "Calls" Screen. Ideally I would like to have it arranged so that it shows, in order, "Calls"," Chats", "Contacts". I don't care if the "Highlights" and "Capture" reside in the upper right. A configuration setting for both custom sounds and main screen functionality would be terrific.
