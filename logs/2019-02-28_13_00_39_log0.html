I know it was there because I could reproduce it at will. I thought, "Maybe I should make them a movie to demonstrate it..." but decided against it because it was so obscure. Someone would have to use the Outline icon on the QAT, then click it while in slide master view. I just deleted the icon and walked away after posting. I had spent enough time on the problem.  But today, since you posted and were trying, I thought I would make a movie for you.  But I could not reproduce the problem by adding Outline back to the QAT. Now my behavior is the same as yours--everything works as expected.  The only mysterious thing is that the Outline icon now looks like the Normal View icon, instead of the look it had before (unless my memory is lying to me).   Anyhow, removing and adding the Outline icon to the QAT has solved my problem, so I\'m happy.  Thank you again Kevin    ', 'vote': '0', 'utterance_time': '2017-07-16T18:28:48', 'affiliation': 'Common User', 'is_answer': 1, 'tags': 'GG FD PA PF'}
